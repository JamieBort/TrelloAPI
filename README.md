### To Do
1. ~~Generate a React project~~
2. Set up .env so that I can make api calls without compromising my key when I push files into git.
3. Then make an api call.
4. then make the api call(s) I am interested in.
5. Lastly create components for the api call.

To fix the dependency tree, try following the steps below in the exact order:

  1. Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.
  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.
  3. Remove "webpack" from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.
  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.
