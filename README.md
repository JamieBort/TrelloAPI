### To Do
1. ~~Generate a React project~~
2. ~~Set up .env so that I can make api calls without compromising my key when I push files into git.~~
3. Then make an api call.
  a. ~~have it load automatically when the component loads.~~
  b. ~~then have it occur when I push a button (create a button)~~
  c. ~~then make a button component in another file and pass the info via props~~
  d. then via state
4. then make the api call(s) I am interested in.
5. Lastly create components for the api call.
